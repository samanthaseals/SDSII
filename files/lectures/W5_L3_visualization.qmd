## Predicted Values for Data Visualization 

- The guidelines we've set up for data visualization still hold true.

- We will put our outcome on the $y$-axis and a continuous (or at least ordinal) predictor on the $x$-axis.

    - We will hold all other predictors constant in order to create lines.

- Recall the logistic regression model,
$$ \ln \left( \frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + ... + \beta_k x_{ki} $$

- We can solve for the probability, which allows us to predict the probability that $y_i=1$ given the specified model:
$$ \pi_i = \frac{\exp\left\{ \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + ... + \beta_k x_{ki} \right\}}{1 + \exp\left\{ \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + ... + \beta_k x_{ki} \right\}} $$
